# VSCode scriptRunner bug

This repository demonstrates a bug where, in subdirectories, VSCodeâ€™s package manager detection for the "npm.scriptRunner" setting does not work as expected. It defaults to npm instead of respecting the "auto" setting (and picking up pnpm in my case).

## The issue:
In my polyglot monorepo setup, when running package.json scripts with the VSCode Explorer "NPM Scripts" view, these scripts would always execute with npm and not pick up that I am using pnpm despite having "npm.scriptRunner" set to "auto". Also initial install with `Run Install` in the Explorer's NPM Scripts view also defaults to npm despite the presence of a `pnpm-lock.yaml`.

## Reproduction
1. Ensure you have Node, PNPM, and NPM installed.
2. The [`package.json`](./bug/package.json) in the `bug` directory contains 3 scripts you may run:
    1. `bug`: will print a simple message.
    2. `script`: will print a message telling you what package manager you ran the command with using the `package-manager-detector` library.
    3. `detect`: will print a message telling you what package manager you ran the command with using a user agent check.


## Workarounds:
- Set the package manager explicitly
  - Add "npm.scriptRunner": "pnpm" to your VSCode settings.
- Add a root-level package.json and dependency
  - Create a package.json in the repo root, install at least one dependency, and ensure a `pnpm-lock.yaml` and/or `node_modules/.modules.yaml` file exists.
- Pull all of the files out of the `bug` directory into the top level and note that PNPM is picked up properly.

## Ineffective Changes:
- Adding "packageManager": "pnpm@10.14.0" to package.json.
- Setting "npm.packageManager" in VSCode settings.
